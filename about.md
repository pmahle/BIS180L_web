This is the website for BIS180L, a computer lab class at [UC Davis](http://www.ucdavis.edu) in the genetics and genomics major.

The website is written in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax), created using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), and served on [github pages](https://pages.github.com/).  I am using the [hyde theme and layout](http://hyde.getpoole.com/).

To see the website source, go to [https://github.com/jnmaloof/BIS180L_web](https://github.com/jnmaloof/BIS180L_web).

Site was created by Julin Maloof with help from Mike Covington.
